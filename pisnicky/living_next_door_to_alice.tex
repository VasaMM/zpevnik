\hlavicka{Livin' Next Door to Alice}{Smokie}

\sloka{
\G Sally called, when she got the word, \\
\C She said "I suppose you've heard \D about Al\G ice.\D"\\
\G So, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside,\\
\C And I could hardly believe my eyes,\\
\D A big limousine pulled slowly into Ali\G ce's drive.\D

\refren{
\G I don't why why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,\\
\C I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know,\\
'Cause for \D twenty four years I've been living next door to \G Alice.\D \\
\G Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance,\\
To \C tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance,\\
Now I've \D gotta get used to not \C living next door to \G Alice.

We grew up together, two kids in the park,\\
Carved our initials deep in the bark\ldots Me and Alice.\\
Now she walks to the door with her head held high,\\
And just for a moment, I caught her eye,\\
As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive.

\sloka{
Then Sally called back, and asked how I felt,\\
She said "I know how to help get over Alice."\\
She said "Now, Alice is gone, but I'm still here.\\
And you know I've been waiting twenty four years\ldots "\\
And the big limousine disappeared\ldots
