\Dmi Mama, she has \DsusCtyri taught me \DmiSiroky{well}\\
\C Told me when I was \Ami young\\
Son, your life's an open book\\
Don't close it before it's done\\
The brighest flame burns quickest,\\
that's what I heard her say,\\
A son's heart's owed to mother\\
But I must find my way

Rebel mind your last name\\
Wild blood in my veins\\
they bring strings around my neck\\
The mark that still remains\\
Left home at an early age\\
Of what I heard was wrong\\
I never asked forgiveness\\
but what is said is done

 \Dmi Never I \G asked you\\
But \C never I \F gave\\
But you gave me your emptiness\\
That I'll take to my grave

\sloka{
Mama now I'm coming home\\
I'm not all you wished of me\\
But a mother's love for her son\\
spoken help me be.\\
I took your love for granted\\
And all the things you said to me\\
I need your arms to welcome me\\
But a cold stone's all I see\\
}

Let my heart go\\
Let your son grow\\
Mama let your heart go\\
Or let his heart be still\\\\

Let my heart go\\
Let your son grow\\
Mama let your heart go\\
Or let his heart be still
